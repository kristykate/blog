<br>
Hi all!<br>
<br>
Another week down (is it just me, or did the week fly by??) and it&apos;s time to wrap up <a href="http://www.spoonflower.com" target="_blank">Spoonflower&apos;s</a> <a href="https://tagboard.com/spoonchallenge" target="_blank">#SpoonChallenge</a>.<br>
<br>
The general theme for the final week was cities, maps and urban life.<br>

<br>
By taking part in the <a href="https://tagboard.com/spoonchallenge" target="_blank">#SpoonChallenge</a> I discovered that there&apos;s a lot of value in sketching with a daily prompt. This activity has been great for getting those creative juices flowing, drawing things I wouldn&apos;t usually consider, and, while they&apos;re not final pieces in themselves, I see potential for new pieces out of the sketches I made over the past 20 days.<br>
<br>
Now that I&apos;ve had a little break from study, it&apos;s time to jump back into figures and anatomy. And it just so happens that I&apos;ve signed up for Pencil Kings next challenge, the <a href="http://www.shadingdrawingchallenge.com/" target="_blank">Shading Drawing Challenge</a> which starts tomorrow (perfect timing!). Can&apos;t wait to see what I learn this time around!<br>
<br>
<br>
Until next time, all the best!<br>

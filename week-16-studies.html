<br>
I completed the Pencil Kings Figure Drawing Challenge! Yay!<br>
<br>
There&apos;s quite a big update ahead so let&apos;s get straight into it:<br>
<br>
<strong>Day 15</strong> Back Anatomy<br>
I really enjoyed learning the muscles in such a simplified way. Exercise 2 involved sketching a figure from photo reference and then adding in the muscles - it was a great activity for gaining a better understanding of how the muscles fit together.<br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Day 16</strong> Figure Drawing<br>
This was basically Exercise 2 from Day 15, but this time with one set of figures drawn from reference, and the other from imagination.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<strong>Day 17 & 18</strong> Perspective<br>
Somehow I got confused with perspective! I felt like I couldn&apos;t "see" where the horizon line and vanishing points should be (despite understanding the general concept) and how to apply the figure to that space. It&apos;s certainly a subject to revisit in the future.<br>
 <br>

<br>

<br>
<strong>Day 19</strong> Pushing Poses<br>
Another really fun exercise - learning to exaggerate aspects of the pose to give the figure more energy. <br>
<br>

<br>
<strong>Day 20</strong> Drawing from Imagination<br>
This wasn&apos;t quite drawing from imagination, rather adapting an existing pose (photo reference was used here) to a different body. Good fun!<br>
<br>
<a href="uploads/2014/07/Day20-01.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="uploads/2014/07/Day20-01.jpg" alt="Day20-01" width="580" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-384" /></a><br>
<br>

<br>
<a href="uploads/2014/07/Day20-03.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="uploads/2014/07/Day20-03.jpg" alt="Day20-03" width="580" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386" /></a><br>
<br>
<a href="uploads/2014/07/Day20-04.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="uploads/2014/07/Day20-04.jpg" alt="Day20-04" width="580" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-387" /></a><br>
<br>
<a href="uploads/2014/07/Day20-05.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="uploads/2014/07/Day20-05.jpg" alt="Day20-05" width="580" height="410" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388" /></a><br>
<br>
And lastly,<br>
<strong>Day 21</strong> Before & After<br>
I decided to compare my new skills to one of the turnarounds I completed in May (roughly 3 weeks before the challenge started). Quite happy to see improvements in the form and pose of the figure. Also, ankles and feet!<br>
<br>

<br>
Some final thoughts on the Pencil Kings Figure Drawing Challenge:<br>
This was a great 4-week course. While I would have personally liked some more detailed information here and there (hands and perspective for instance), I believe the course met what it had set out to achieve. The exercises, accompanied with Sycra&apos;s instructional videos, took complicated subject matter and made it easy to digest, giving artists a good foundation in drawing the human body from both reference and imagination.<br>
<br>
If you&apos;re having trouble understanding human anatomy and would like to improve your skills I definitely recommend checking out Pencil Kings future Figure Drawing Challenges - I believe there will be another course later this year.<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>

Back in June I had the pleasure of being Leonie Yue&apos;s very first guest on her Hermit Burpcast. In this podcast (starting roughly 30mins in) we discuss our own experiences with art anxiety and our thoughts on Julia Cameron&apos;s self-help book "The Artist&apos;s Way".<br>
<br>
If you&apos;ve been struggling with art anxiety or what&apos;s commonly called "Artist&apos;s Block", I recommend having a listen. We share some lessons that might just help.<br>
<br>
(I&apos;d even say it&apos;s worth a listen just to hear us geeking out about Pokemon!)<br>
<br>
Enjoy, and I&apos;d love to hear your thoughts on our discussion.<br>

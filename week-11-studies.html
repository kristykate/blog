<br>
Week 11 = hand studies! I studied the construction and proportions of the hand from Loomis&apos; <em>Drawing the </em><i>Head &amp; Hands</i> and also made sketches based on the plates from Bridgman&apos;s <em>The Book of a Hundred Hands</em> and by using my own hand for reference.<br>

<br>
There&apos;s still so much to learn in regards to drawing hands and I will need to revisit them more thoroughly in the future. My gut however, is telling me to concentrate on the limbs over the next two weeks (before it&apos;s time for the 3rd turnaround sheet) to better understand their relation to the torso and how they connect with the hands and feet.<br>
<br>
Within the next few months I&apos;d like to jump into more rendered (digital) studies and begin experimenting with character sketches. While learning anatomy is a priority, I&apos;m wary of falling into the perfectionist trap of holding myself back from other areas until the anatomy is <em>perfect</em>. In reality, anatomy takes years of dedicated study to master, and even then, artists use reference. Building an understanding of anatomy through studies alone is fantastic, but I wonder if making a start on character designs and illustrations now will be a better platform for improvement?<br>
<br>
It&apos;s worth a try!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>

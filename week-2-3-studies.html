<br>
What a busy fortnight it has been!<br>
<br>
Between travels in Adelaide and attending the ACMI DreamWorks Exhibition live talks and industry masterclass, I haven&apos;t had as much time to study as I would have liked. Not necessarily a bad thing though as I got to see and experience so many wonderful artworks and insights â€“ all that I hope to share with you in the near future.<br>
<br>
Aside from a few Loomis and sculpture studies (images 1 &amp; 2 below), I took the spare time I had to focus on drawing people in public. After the initial awkwardness of setting up and gazing at randoms, I was surprised I had shied away from this activity for so long - it is such a blast and a great way to improve visual memory!<br>
<br>
I&apos;ll definitely be looking at incorporating it further into my study plans.<br>

<h2>Blocking in the Shadow Value of the Head</h2><br>
I&apos;m going to keep this post short today, as I feel much of the concept of &apos;blocking in the shadows&apos; was already covered in my earlier post <a title="SDC – Planes &amp; Blocking in the Shadow Value" href="http://blog.kristykate.com/2014/09/11/sdc-planes-blocking-in-the-shadow-value/" target="_blank">SDC - Planes and Blocking in the Shadow Value</a>.<br>
<br>
<em>Lesson 5: Blocking in the Shadows of the Head</em> is essentially a stepping stone activity between learning the planes and fully shading the head. Not a bad thing at all as it got me thinking about what planes of the head would receive light and shadow under different lighting conditions.<br>
<br>

<br>
Applying the basic area of shadow really helped me to see how the planes turn and curve and come together as a whole. It also made me more conscious of the position of the light source.<br>

Looking back over these studies, I can see I missed a few shadows here and there. It pays to keep in mind that when blocking in the shadow value you are covering<em> all</em> shadows, including the core shadow, cast shadow and reflected light. Reflected light can sometimes be misleading and look like the mid tone or an area of light.<br>
<br>
Look out for where the mid tone turns to shadow or core shadow too. The transition can be quite smooth, so in that situation I tend to block in the shadow up to the core shadow.<br>
<br>

Since we&apos;ve been using the templates and reference photos Diane supplied a lot, it was fun to break away in the final exercise of the lesson and sketch out our own templates to apply the planes and shadow area to (see above image). I selected stock photos from Marcus Ranum&apos;s collection (check out <a title="http://mjranum-stock.deviantart.com" href="http://mjranum-stock.deviantart.com" target="_blank">mjranum-stock.deviantart.com</a>) to use as reference. It felt a little surreal sketching again... I suppose I have been concentrating on area and painting instead of line!<br>
<br>
I think a great supplemental activity to this lesson would be to experiment creating your own lighting and apply it to the planes of the head. Perhaps create a template of the head (constructed out of planes) from the front and side view, duplicate it a dozen times and start blocking in the shadows from different lighting set ups. It would be a great way to test your knowledge of the planes and have a future reference for painting from imagination. (I&apos;ll have to try it myself when I have time).<br>

Up next is the best part of the week, rendering the entire head in SDC Lesson 6: Shading the Face in Full Value.<br>

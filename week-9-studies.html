<br>
It&apos;s Anatomy Turnaround Sheet time!<br>
<br>
<em>What&apos;s the Anatomy Turnaround Sheet, you ask?</em><br>
<br>
Each month I test my human anatomy knowledge by completing a male and female Anatomy Turnaround Sheet entirely from memory. From these sheets I can determine gaps in my understanding by observing the areas I struggled to draw and anatomical inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
This is the second time I have completed the exercise and boy, am I excited! <em>(For comparison, the first attempt can be seen in the <a href="http://blog.kristykate.com/2014/05/02/week-4-5-studies/">Week 4 &amp; 5 Studies</a> post.)</em><br>

Already there was quite a difference in my level of confidence while drawing the figure. 4 weeks ago I was really struggling to visualise the human body and spent 2hrs drawing and redrawing the figures to achieve something acceptable looking. This time around, I halved the time it took to draw the figures and reworked very little (you&apos;ll see some scratchiness with the shoulders and heads). To me, that&apos;s a fairly significant improvement!<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, there&apos;s still much to improve on. Here&apos;s what I feel needs more work:<br>
<ul><br>
 <li>Structure of the limbs (they&apos;re really not-quite-right!)</li><br>
  <li>Structure of the hands and feet</li><br>
  <li>Side-view (need more tilt in the upper torso and structure in the legs)</li><br>
  <li>Proportional widths (some areas appear too wide, such as the neck and torso)</li><br>
 <li>Form and balance (3/4 view says it all - had particular trouble with the shoulders, hip-backside-leg connection and legs)</li><br>
</ul><br>
For this upcoming month, art study will be focused on:<br>
<ol><br>
 <li>Arms and legs (construction and proportion)</li><br>
  <li>Hands and feet (construction and proportion)</li><br>
 <li>More face/head studies (missed out on these last month), and</li><br>
 <li>More gesture/figure studies</li><br>
</ol><br>
Looking forward to digging into some more anatomy this month - bring on Anatomy Turnaround Sheet #3!<br>
<br>
Until then, all the best!<br>

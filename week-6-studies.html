<br>
After feeling unsatisfied with a lack of art study, I made it my goal over the weekend to assess my schedule and achieve a better balance between tasks.<br>
<br>
The result was a revised weekly schedule and a couple of changes to implement:<br>
<ul><br>
 <li>Monday mornings are now set aside for blog updates.</li><br>
  <li>Have shorter, 15min max breaks AWAY from the screen - I was surprised to discover that breaks would easily hit 30mins or more due to reading various articles and posts online.</li><br>
  <li>Set aside a minimum of 20mins-1hr of art study on weeknights, and at least 2hrs of digital painting (and/or art study) on the weekend.</li><br>
</ul><br>
Hopefully within the next week or two we&apos;ll see an improvement in my art study habits!<br>
<br>
Over the weekend I also completed some anatomy studies, looking at the proportions of the &apos;ideal&apos; female body and more specifically, the torso.<br>
<br>
These first studies look pretty stumpy (more observation on the proportional widths of the body required).<br>
<br>

<br>
And the torso studies - slowly building a better understanding of the waist-hip-leg placement.<br>

<br>
Lastly, some sketches of faces seen on tv or in magazines.<br>

<br>
And that&apos;s all for week 6!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>

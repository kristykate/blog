<br>
Time for the monthly Anatomy Turnaround!<br>
<br>
<em>(For those that are unfamiliar with this exercise; once a month I draw a turnaround sheet of the male and female figure - from imagination - to measure my progress in learning human anatomy).</em><br>
<br>

And for comparison, here&apos;s all 4 sets of turnaround sheets that I&apos;ve completed over the past 3 months:<br>

While I&apos;m still very good at being nit-picky over my current work, gosh it makes me happy to look back at how far I&apos;ve come in just 3 months of study. Anatomy has always felt like a big scary undertaking, but these pictures show that, if you just keep working at it, progress really is guaranteed.<br>
<br>
(I can&apos;t wait to look back on this post in 3-6 months and laugh at just how little I know!)<br>
<br>
Now that I&apos;ve made progress with understanding the basics of human anatomy, I feel it&apos;s time to start shifting my focus and aim higher.<br>
<br>
My next steps towards character design (over the next 6 months):<br>
<ul><br>
  <li>Draw lots of figure studies (and push the pose!)</li><br>
 <li>Complete more muscle studies</li><br>
 <li>Draw turnarounds (more than once a month) to really cement my understanding of the human figure from different views</li><br>
 <li>Draw lots of studies of the hands and feet</li><br>
 <li>Draw lots of faces and study the construction of facial features</li><br>
 <li>Complete master studies (figurative)</li><br>
 <li>Study the design of existing characters</li><br>
  <li>Experiment with and exaggerate the proportions and shapes of figures and faces</li><br>
 <li>Study, practice, play!</li><br>
</ul><br>
Most importantly, it is time to step out of my comfort zone and<br>
<ul><br>
 <li>Start designing human characters!</li><br>
</ul><br>
It&apos;s an ambitious list and I haven&apos;t quite figured out where this will fit into my current schedule, but I accept the challenge!<br>
<br>
Wish me luck!<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>

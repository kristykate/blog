<html><head></head><body><h1>Be Prepared!</h1><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Whether it was reciting the Girl Guides motto or singing along to The Lion King soundtrack, as a child I quickly picked up that it pays to <i>Be Prepared!</i></span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Now that I&apos;m undertaking my own self-directed education, those two words couldn&apos;t be more valid.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Studying art can be overwhelming. There&apos;s so much to learn, to master—and with limited time and resources it can be hard to know where to begin.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">The remedy? Be prepared - make a study plan.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">A study plan is a guide to what you need to learn and keeps you on track to achieving your goals. When developing my own study plan, I found it was best to start with the end goal in mind and research what it takes to get there.</span></span><br>
<blockquote><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;"><i>TIP: Research relevant job descriptions and course information - they will provide you with valuable insight towards the skills you need to focus on developing.</i></span></span></blockquote><br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">After some research into visual development art, I was able to summarise everything I need to learn into four key categories or “study threads”:</span></span><br>
<ul><br>
  <li><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Character Design</span></span></li><br>
 <li><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Environment Design</span></span></li><br>
 <li><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Visual Storytelling</span></span></li><br>
  <li><span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">General Skills</span></span></li><br>
</ul><br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Grouping subjects into a study thread establishes a clear link to your end goal – and removes the intimidation of a never-ending “to-study” list.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;">For instance, the subjects <i>human anatomy, animal anatomy, gesture &amp; expression, costume</i>, and <i>design principles</i> work together to achieve the larger goal of Character Design. On their own, it&apos;s unclear what end point is trying to be achieved, which can lead to confusion in your studies.</span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">When working through the subjects in a study thread, I find it helps to divide them into “study blocks” (eg. Study Block 1 – Human Anatomy, Study Block 2 – Animal Anatomy, and so on). Each study block can then be used to build and easily access a list of the resources and exercises relevant to mastering that particular subject. </span></span><br>
<blockquote><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif; color: #666666;"><i>TIP: Flesh out just one study thread and 1-2 study blocks at a time. It&apos;s very easy to get caught up in building a comprehensive study plan and forget you should make a start on your studies!</i></span></blockquote><br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">Building a study plan is an ongoing process. I&apos;m confident mine will need revisions with the more I learn and discover, but even a rough study plan is beneficial. I&apos;m not wasting time on irrelevant work and can see a clear connection between my studies and the end goal. Overall, a study plan makes the journey ahead much less daunting.</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">If you haven&apos;t already, consider creating your own study plan</span><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">, it&apos;s worth it!</span></span><br>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666666;">+ + +</span></p><br>
<span style="color: #666666;"><span style="font-family: &apos;Noto Serif&apos;, serif;">On a side note;<br>
I will be undertaking the Character Design thread of my study plan first, starting with Human Anatomy. A bunch of studies are on their way and will be posted soon!</span></span></body></html>

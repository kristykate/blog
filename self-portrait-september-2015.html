My last profile picture was feeling a little outdated, so I figured it was time for a new self-portrait:<br>
<br>
<a href="uploads/2015/09/20150906-SelfPortrait-Web.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-703" src="uploads/2015/09/20150906-SelfPortrait-Web.jpg" alt="Self-portrait of Kristy Kate" width="580" /></a> <br>
<br>
To create this self-portrait I used a mix of recent photos as reference. I sketched and digitally painted the full illustration in Photoshop, finishing with a few paint textures from <a href="http://www.texturemate.com/" target="_blank">Texture Mate</a>.<br>
<br>
After such a long break, it feels great to be getting back into art again. <br>
<br>
Until next time!<br>
x Kristy Kate<br>

Hi there, I&apos;m Kristy Kate, a Melbourne based freelance artist. I love to create colourful illustrations and designs that explore fun characters and their worlds.<br>
<br>
My ultimate dream is to become a world class visual development artist.<br>
<br>
I still have a lot to learn (all artists do), but I&apos;m ready to put in the hard work to make this dream a reality.<br>
<br>
I would love to share my journey with you.<br>
<br>
So welcome to my blog, where I will be documenting my art, studies and experiences in the pursuit of my dream.Â With time, I hope it will become a great record of my progress and a resource for aspiring professional artists.<br>
<br>
Now, without further ado,<br>
Let the journey begin!<br>
<br>
x Kristy Kate<br>

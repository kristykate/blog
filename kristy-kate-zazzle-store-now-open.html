Hip-hip-hooray! Kristy Kate designs are now available on <a href="href=&quot;http://www.zazzle.com.au/kristykate*?tc=MyBlog&quot;" target="_blank">Zazzle</a>!<br>
<br>
<em>(This has been on my to-do list for a while, so I&apos;m a teensy bit excited!)</em><br>
<br>
I&apos;ve been a busy bee over the past two weeks uploading all my current designs, so everything you&apos;ve seen at the conventions I&apos;ve attended are now available online. I&apos;m especially excited to see my badge/magnet designs start new lives as stickers, keychains, necklaces and even melamine plates!<br>
<br>
It&apos;s early days and I still have a few more pieces to upload before I start on brand new designs, but if you have a spare moment to drop by the <a href="href=&quot;http://www.zazzle.com.au/kristykate*?tc=MyBlog&quot;" target="_blank">Kristy Kate Store</a>, I&apos;d love to hear your feedback!<br>
<br>
Plus, if there&apos;s anything you&apos;d like to see added to the collection - be it a new design or an existing design on another product - I&apos;m open to your suggestions. I want to fill the store with plenty of fun, cute and colourful designs to brighten everyone&apos;s day.<br>

Here&apos;s the link one more time:<br>

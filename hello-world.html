Hello and Happy 2015!<br>
<em>(...I think I missed the "Happy New Year" window. Oops!)</em><br>
<br>
It has been a long time between posts, my friends, and for that I apologise. Does anyone else feel like the past 4 months have flown by in an instant? I had to flip through my diary to figure out where on Earth it went.<br>
<br>
Turns out I&apos;ve been busy. <em>Ha! Lame excuse, I know.</em><br>
<br>
I&apos;ve had all the best intentions to post, but work and family commitments meant I had to shelve blogging for a while. My little sister got married and I had a bunch of awesome projects to work on, including designing stationery for the wedding and a co-hosting gig with Pencil Kings on their Perspective Drawing Challenge and Figure Drawing Challenge. It has been a busy time, but an exciting one too!<br>
<br>
Then art anxiety decided to come and bite me on the butt. Because it&apos;s<em> cool</em> like that.<br>
<br>
I won&apos;t delve into the intricacies of it today, but let&apos;s just say it really blew the wind out of my sails. Anxiety is terribly exhausting, and as a result I&apos;ve had to save my energy for client work and making a recovery. It&apos;s left very little time to pursue my own projects, including this blog.<br>
<br>
The good news is, it&apos;s helped me see that I need to scale back. Simplify. Be selective about what I really want and need to do.<br>
<br>
With small baby steps, I will work towards a return in regular blogging, studies and creating art again. It will require a good deal of patience and persistence, but I look to the road ahead with great optimism. I&apos;ve got this.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your kind support along the way. :-)<br>
<br>
Until next time,<br>
